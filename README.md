Task 02 : Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption in Python.

 This document explores a novel approach to image encryption using pixel manipulation in Python. Leveraging cryptographic algorithms and libraries like Pillow and NumPy, individual pixel values undergo substitution, permutation, and diffusion to enhance security. The implementation is compared with conventional methods, highlighting its potential for robust and efficient image encryption, crucial in securing digital information.
